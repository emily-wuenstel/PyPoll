# PyPoll
Hello! Like in the Pybank HW, I had trouble with committing to git. 

for this one, the election_data.csv must be in the SAME folder as the pypoll.py - do not put it in a resources folder or it will fail. It's going to look for the csv in the same folder. I have included a notepad with my code as backup. Thank you!
